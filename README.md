# vue3-mail

Just a project during learning Vue3. Written with vue cli, vue3, and typescript.

This original idea is from [a course of Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/build-a-gmail-clone-with-vue3/select-all-checkbox/), but with typescript and fewer features.

## How to run it

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn` to install deps
3. Run `yarn dev` to start a mock api server and webpack dev server concurrently
